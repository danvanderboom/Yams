**YAMS** (Yet Another Microservices Solution) is a library that can be used to deploy and host microservices on premises, in Azure, or on other cloud service platforms. It offers the following features:
* **Quick deployments** of microservices to any target environment (~1 minute deployments to Azure). 
* **Sharing infrastructure** (multiple microservices can be deployed to the same on premises or cloud service). 
* **Scaling microservices independently**.
* **Versioning** of microservices, quick **updates**, **reverts**, etc. 
* Support for **Upgrade Domains** to minimize (and potentially eliminate) application downtime during updates, including first-class support for **Azure Upgrade Domains**.
* Microservices can be developed in **any programming language** and deployed with YAMS (as long as your service can be started with an exe).

YAMS has first-class support for deploying applications from Azure **blob storage**, but with its pluggable storage architecture, other providers such as SQL Server or file storage can be created and plugged in as well.

To deploy an application to a YAMS cluster, simply drop the binaries of the application into YAMS deployment storage. The binaries are then picked-up by YAMS, deployed to all VMs in the cluster, and then launched.

Please read the documentation below for more information.
